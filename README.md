# 🌳 OptiRoute Pro 🧮

## 📝 Description

This C++ program implements Prim's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a given graph. It's perfect for network design, optimizing connections, or solving various graph-related problems!

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 Build custom graphs with nodes and weighted edges
- 🔍 Find the Minimum Spanning Tree using Prim's algorithm
- 📈 Calculate the total weight of the MST
- 🖨️ Print the path coordinates and distances

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++)
2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Sandheep-S-95/OptiRoute-Pro.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd OptiRoute-Pro
   ```
4. Compile the program:
   ```
   g++ main.cpp
   ```

## 🎮 Usage

1. Run the compiled program:
   ```
   ./main.cpp
   ```
2. Follow the prompts to input your graph data:
   - Enter the number of nodes
   - Enter the names of each node
   - Enter the number of edges
   - For each edge, enter the source node, destination node, and weight

3. The program will output the Minimum Spanning Tree and its total weight.

## 📊 Example

```
Enter the number of nodes: 4
Enter node names:
A B C D
Enter the edges and weights (from to weight):
6
A B 5
B C 3
C D 2
D A 4
A C 7
B D 6
From: C To: D Distance: 2
From: B To: C Distance: 3
From: A To: B Distance: 5
Total Minimum Spanning Tree Weight: 10
```
